## Projects
### Sales Insights Data Analysis Project - Atliq Hardware

This project is based on a computer hardware business which is facing challenges in dynamically changing market. Sales director decides to invest in data analysis project and he would like to build power BI dashboard that can give him real time sales insights. These records are stored in mysql database. Power BI is plugged to this database to pull necessary information required for data analysis. The database has all sales transactions, customers, products and markets information. I analyzed this database and than hook it up with power BI. In power BI, I performed ETL and data cleaning operations (currency normalization, handling invalid values etc) to make it ready so that I can build my dashboard. I performed valuable insights using mySQL and Power BI to discover customer behavior, identify patterns, and make data-driven recommendations to improve company sales strategies.

### Supermarket Sales Insights Dashboard

It is a Sales Data Analysis assessment prepared by Intern2Grow, for its Data Analyst Virtual Internship Program. The objective is to use data analysis skills to answer the questions and present all the findings in a clear and concise manner. The dataset that provided to me was a CSV file named sales_data.csv. It contains information about sales made by a fictional company over the course of a year. It contains attributes such as date, product, category, price, and quantity. I cleaned (removed missing values, handled incomplete values) and manipulated the data provided in the CSV file. 

Assessment Questions:
- What was the total revenue generated by the company over the course of the year?
- Which product had the highest revenue? How much revenue did it generate?
- What was the average price of a product sold by the company?
- What was the total quantity of products sold by the company?
- Which category had the highest revenue? How much revenue did it generate?
- What was the average revenue per sale?
- What was the total revenue generated in each quarter of the year? (i.e. Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)

Insights:
- $745,000 was the total revenue generated by the company over the course of the year.
- Smartphones generated the highest revenue of $428,000.
- $48,600 was the average price of smartphone sold by the company.
- The total quantity of products sold by the company is 5240.
- Electronics generated the highest revenue of $509,000.
- $142.25 was the average revenue per sale.
- The total revenue generated in each quarter of the year are: $182,000 in Q1, $177,000 in Q2, $194,000 in Q3 and $192,000 in Q4. 

For the data cleaning, manipulation, analysis and visualization, I used Microsoft Power BI. I submitted my assessment as an interactive dashboard on Github.
